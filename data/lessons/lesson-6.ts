                True ROI can only be calculated when the Total Cost of Ownershipâ€”including human adoptionâ€”is 
                understood. The team's "Change Management" plan is dangerously simplistic and guarantees the 
                project will fail to realize its value. Your task is to formulate questions to help the team 
                think more deeply about driving user adoption.
